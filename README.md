My first backend project.
Technology used :- HTML/CSS, Javascript, ExpressJS, EJS, BootStrap, PostgreSQL and SQL.

The goal of the project is to create an application that helps in creating new users and new schedules. 
I have used PostgreSQL and created too tables(Users and Schedules) in the database. 
I have used EJS as frontend and used Bootstrap for styling the pages. 
I have also provided form validation on both front end and backend. 

Steps for viewing the project:-
1. git clone https://github.com/raopoo/MrCoffees-ScheduleWebsite.git
2. npm install 
3. npm install nodemon --save-dev
4. nodemon index.js
